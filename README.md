# PopularMovies

An app that gives an overview of most popular and top rated movies. 

The main screen provides a list of movies by displaying their poster image.

Depending on the user preferences, the movies are displayed either by popularity or rating. 

By clicking on a movie poster, the app displays details about the movie.

In the next version of the app, the user will be able to play the movie's trailer.

The data are queried from the themoviedb.org' API

P.S. This App was not created for commercial use.

## Prerequisites

Exept for the mockup, the owner of this github profile is the only contributor to this app.
