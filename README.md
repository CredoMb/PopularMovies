# PopularMovies

An app that gives an overview of most popular and top rated movies. 
Using a RecyclerView, the App displays movie posters queried from themoviedb.org API 

Clicking on a movie poster opens a new Activity that contains details about the given movie. 
In the next version of the app, the user will be able to play the movie's trailer.

The App was not created for commercial use.

**P.S.This project is still under construction**.

## Prerequisites 

* Android SDK v29
* Android Build Tools v29.0.2

## Contributors

The mockup used to draw the application's layout was inspired by multiple templates available online and 
also by the Netflix app UI. 

Exept for the mockup, the owner of this github profile is the only contributor to this app.
New Ideas and innovative concepts are welcomed :)
